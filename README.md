# Welcome to TokSearch

TokSearch is a Python package for parallel retrieving, processing, and filtering of arbitrary-dimension fusion experimental data. TokSearch provides a high level API for extracting information from many shots, along with useful classes for low level data retrieval and manipulation.

The fundamental class in TokSearch is the ```Pipeline```. A ```Pipeline``` object takes a list of shots and, for each shot in the list, creates a dict-like object called a ```Record```. The ```Pipeline``` object then provides methods for defining a sequence of processing steps to apply to each record. These processing steps include:

- Passing user-defined functions to the pipeline via the ```map``` method.

or...

- Using a set of built-in methods, such as ```fetch```, ```fetch_dataset```, ```align```, ```keep```, or ```discard```.

The ```Pipeline``` also provides a ```where``` method which takes as input a user-defined function that returns a boolean value. If the function evaluates to ```False``` for a record, then that record is removed from the pipeline.
